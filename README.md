# üß† Networking Labs Collection

A collection of hands-on networking labs demonstrating core routing protocols and concepts using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.  
Each lab includes a `.pkt` file and network topology image for visualization.

---

## üìò Overview

This repository contains practical implementations of key routing techniques used in real-world networks.  
All configurations were built and tested in **Cisco Packet Tracer**, focusing on understanding the logic and verification of routing behaviors.

## üß© Labs Included

| Lab Name | Routing Type | Description |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| [Static Routing](./static-routing/) | Manual Routing | Routes are manually configured on each router, providing full control but no scalability. |
| [RIP (Routing Information Protocol)](./rip/) | Dynamic Distance-Vector | Simple dynamic routing using hop count as a metric (RIPv2). |
| [EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)](./eigrp/) | Dynamic Hybrid | Cisco-proprietary protocol offering fast convergence and efficient routing. |
| [OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)](./ospf/) | Dynamic Link-State | Industry-standard link-state routing protocol with area-based design for scalability. |

## üß† Learning Objectives

- Understand the difference between **static** and **dynamic** routing.
- Learn how routers exchange routes using different algorithms (Distance Vector vs. Link State).
- Practice verifying and troubleshooting routing tables.
- Build and interpret small-to-medium enterprise topologies.
